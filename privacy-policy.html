    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how your personal data is handled by the DPI Metadata Converter (referred to as "the Tool") in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Tool is designed to modify the DPI metadata of images on your device without transmitting any data to external servers. Your privacy and the protection of your data are of utmost importance to us.</p>

        <h2>Data Controller</h2>
        <p>As the developers of the Tool, we act as the data controller for any personal data processed using the Tool. However, the Tool is designed to ensure that no personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted by us.</p>

        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Data Collection:</strong> The Tool does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or images. All image processing is done locally on your device, within your web browser. No data leaves your device at any point.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Data Usage:</strong> The Tool operates entirely in your browser, using client-side processing to modify the DPI metadata of images. No data is sent to any external server or third party.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Data Storage:</strong> As no data is collected, there is no data storage involved in the operation of the Tool.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Data Sharing:</strong> The Tool does not share any data with third parties. Since no data is transmitted or stored, there is nothing to share.</p>

        <h2>User Rights</h2>
        <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You have the right to request access to any personal data that may be processed. However, since the Tool does not process any personal data, there is no data to access.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request corrections to any inaccuracies in your personal data. Again, since the Tool does not process or store personal data, this right is not applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. As the Tool does not store any personal data, there is no data to delete.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. Since no processing occurs outside your device, this right is not applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request your data in a portable format. Since the Tool does not collect or store any personal data, this right is not applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. No such processing occurs with the Tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is ensured by the Tool's design. All processing occurs locally on your device, and no data is transmitted to external servers. This ensures that your data remains under your control at all times.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
